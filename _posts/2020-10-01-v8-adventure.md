Study the v8 source code from the beginning and more.

## Why V8 and why from the beginning?
- I'm working mostly as Javascript developer, but I'm also interested in C++ source code.
V8 is perfect land for me to explorer interesting C++ concepts and to understand Javascript better.
- Current code base of V8 is huge, I cannot jump right into it and learn everything.
So I decide to go back in time to see V8 in its initial shape. Less toolings, hacks, optimizations... that I
can not digest right now.


## What do I've known before start studying V8 and you should too
- C++, of course (my level is about basic to low intermediate)
- Algorithms and Data structure (important)
- I read a book about [implementing scripting language](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)
- Love reading people's code :100:

## If you are still reading
Good luck to us. I don't know where this will lead us to. I hope we can take some thing out of the ancient V8 that still valid in most recent versions.
