Some tricks I found when dealing with V8 giant code base
- Having problem understanding v8 macros?  
    - Add this where ever you want
      ```cpp
      static const int IAmHere = 1;
      ```
    - And run  
      ```sh
      g++ -g -Wall -I.  -Iinclude -I... header.h   -E -D DEBUG > header.h.o
      ```
    - Search for `IAmHere` in `header.h.o file` generated
    - Have fun
- To be continued
